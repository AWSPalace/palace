# Troubleshooting EPR Analysis in Palace with SQDMetal

## Issues Identified

1. **Empty mesh file**: The mesh file generation is failing, resulting in an empty mesh file
2. **Missing eig.csv**: The simulation can't find the eigenmode solutions file
3. **Performance issues**: The customized EPR implementation is slower without providing better results

## Diagnostic Tools

I've created several diagnostic tools to help identify the source of these issues:

1. **check_mesh.sh**: A shell script that examines your mesh files and Palace configuration files
   - Run this with: `./debug_info/check_mesh.sh`
   - It will identify empty mesh files and check if your configuration references them correctly

2. **check_jj.cpp**: A C++ program to verify if your configuration contains Josephson junction definitions
   - Compile with: `g++ -o debug_info/check_jj debug_info/check_jj.cpp`
   - Run with: `./debug_info/check_jj your_config.json`

## Recommendations for Fixing the Issues

### 1. Mesh Generation Issues

When using SQDMetal with Palace, ensure:

- The mesh generation command has the correct file paths
- The directory where the mesh should be saved exists and has write permissions
- If using a script to generate the mesh, check it for errors and silent failures

Common issues:
- Relative vs absolute paths: Ensure the mesh path in your config is consistent with where it's generated
- Cross-platform issues: If running on Windows with WSL, check path translation issues
- Gmsh compatibility: Verify you're using a compatible version of Gmsh for mesh generation

### 2. EPR Analysis Optimization

Looking at the code changes for EPR analysis:

- The custom convergence criteria (in `ErrorIndicator`) only activates for elements containing Josephson junctions
- The key change (line 348-356 in eigensolver.cpp) checks if any ports are of type `JOSEPHSON`
- The convergence is weighted more heavily for JJ elements with a weight factor of 3.0 (line 35 in errorindicator.hpp)

Possible issues:
- **Missing JJ identification**: Your configuration might not be properly identifying Josephson junctions
- **Convergence criteria too strict**: The implementation requires 3 consecutive converged iterations
- **Over-weighted error**: The JJ weight of 3.0 may be slowing convergence unnecessarily

### 3. Performance Optimization

To improve performance while ensuring accurate EPR analysis:

1. **Targeted refinement**: Instead of weighting the entire JJ elements, consider only increasing refinement specifically around the junction area
2. **Adaptive tolerance**: Modify the code to use a stricter tolerance only for regions with JJs, not globally
3. **Two-phase approach**: Run a coarse simulation first, then a refined one only for elements containing JJs

### 4. Configuration Changes

Ensure your Palace configuration has:

1. Properly defined Josephson junctions with type explicitly set to "josephson"
2. Correct mesh file path
3. Adaptive refinement settings appropriate for EPR analysis

Example configuration snippet:
```json
{
  "problem": {
    "type": "eigenmode",
    "mesh_file": "path/to/your_mesh.msh"
  },
  "boundaries": {
    "ports": [
      {
        "name": "jj1",
        "type": "josephson",
        "surfaces": [101],
        "inductance": 1e-9
      }
    ]
  },
  "solver": {
    "eigenmode": {
      "n": 10,
      "tol": 1e-6,
      "max_it": 100
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. First run the diagnostic tools to pinpoint the specific issues
2. Fix the mesh generation process
3. Verify your configuration properly identifies Josephson junctions
4. Fine-tune the convergence parameters if necessary (errorindicator.hpp)
